### Project Title
Bikeshare

### Description
This Python script, `bikeshare.py`, analyzes bikeshare data for three U.S. cities: **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington**. It prompts the user to select a city and apply filters based on month and day of the week. The script loads relevant data, calculates various statistics—such as the most popular travel times, stations, trip durations, and user demographics—and allows users to view individual trip data. The program runs in a loop, allowing users to restart the analysis as desired.
